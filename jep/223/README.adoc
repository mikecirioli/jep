== Abstract

When using matrix-based access control the permission types `Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS`, `PluginManager.CONFIGURE_UPDATECENTER`, and `PluginManager.UPLOAD_PLUGINS` provide a false sense of security, as a user is able to escalate this limited privilege to `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`.  
link:https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-04-10/#matrix-authorization-strategy-plugin-allowed-configuring-dangerous-permissions[SECURITY-410] removed the ability to individually grant these permissions, as they are effectively equivalent to `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`.

A new permission type, `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` (implied by `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`) has been created for actions that allow for the management of Jenkins configuration items that do not require `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`.
This new permission is used to create a clear separation between settings that impact the entirety of a Jenkins instance (particularly with regards to security) and those that can be used to manage other aspects of an installation. 
This type of permission is a form of "Limited Administer" capability, a term used to describe permissions that can be used to delegate the ability to manage specifc aspects of an instance without granting an overall administrative capability.

== Specification

Any methods that check for `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`, `Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS`, `PluginManager.CONFIGURE_UPDATECENTER`, and `PluginManager.UPLOAD_PLUGINS` will be evaluated to determine if the use of the new `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` permission type is appropriate.
The general rule of thumb is that configuration item which does not let you change the underlying security model (either directly, or through a malicious plugin or groovy script), or change fundamental configurations such as hostnames, proxy configuration, etc. are likely candidates to use the `Jenkins.CONFIGURE`.

The changes to the existing permissions are detailed in the diagram below.

=== Jenkins UX Changes
Changing the permission model primarily impacts the Jenkins UX in two ways; the permissions shown when configuring matrix-based authentication, and on the `Manage Jenkins` page. 

Using the `Matrix Authorization` plugin, create two users, each with only one permission: `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` or `Jenkins.CONFIGURE`.

image::UX_matrix_auth.png[Permissions configuration with matrix authorization plugin.]

By default, all of the configuration sections in the `/manage` page require `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`.
Each configuration section that is accessbile by a user with `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` are explicitly allowed by overriding `ManagementLink.getRequiredPermission()` to return `Jenkins.CONFIGURE`. For example :

```java
public class CustomLink extends ManagementLink {

    @Override
    public Permission getRequiredPermission() {
        return Jenkins.CONFIGURE;
    }
}
```

Plugins may also need to change also permission on jelly files to allow `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` on management links.

image::UX_manage_page.png[User interface for the new permission.]


Most configuration links are fully avalaible for users with either permission, with the following exceptions:


1. *Administrative Monitors* - Administrattive Monitor messages will only be shown if the user has the permission `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` because they may containan action button that can lead to security modifications. 

2. *Configure Global Security* - A user who can make changes here is able to configure Jenkins to use a less secure realm, or grant themselves additional permissions, thus this configuration link will only be shown to users with the `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` permission.

3. *Manage Plugins* - A user with the ability to manage plugins is able to remove or replace security related plugins, or even upload a malicious plugin, thus this configuration link will only be shown to users with the `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` permission.

4. *Manage Users* - Managing users includes the ability to delete any user, so this link will only be shown to users with the `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` permission.

5. *Configure System* - As it is currently implemented, the Jenkins _Configure System_ page contains a mix of items, some of which should require `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` and some which are safe to delegate to a user with the `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` permission.  
Splitting these into seperate pages is outside the scope of this JEP, so the _Configure System_ link will be visible to users with either `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` or `Jenkins.CONFIGURE`.
A detailed description of the permission changes for this page can be found below.
 
image::UX_config_tools.png[Configure System details.]
The following configuration settings found under `/configure` will only be shown and allowed to modify to users with `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` permission, because they can lead to permissions escalation:

* `# of executors`: to avoid a user to set a non-zero value 
* `Jenkins URL`: can be used to redirect users to another jenkins instance, leading to a phishing attack
* `Resource root`: can be used to point to a host with malicicus code and cause a XSS atack on jenkins users
* `Global properties`: can be used to missconfigure the existant tools and execute malicius code in its place
    * `Environment variables`
    * `Tool Locations`
* `Administrative monitors configuration`: this doesn't allow permissions escalation by itself, but a user can change monitors settings to hide security warnings from Administer.
* `Shell executable path`: can be used to point to a executable with malicius code and escalate permissions

[NOTE]
====
Plugins that contribute to the settings on on the `Configure Jenkins` page should carefully consider if allowing a user with only `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` could result in an unintended privelege escalation.
====

== Motivation

The current permission model provides does not provide a means by which some aspects of Jenkins administration can be delegated to a user without also giving them the ability (directly or indirectly) to modify configuration settings that globablly impact the instance.

By consolidating all permission types that effectively allow a user to have full `root` access on a Jenkins instance, and introducing a new permission (`Jenkins.CONFIGURE`) that allows a limited amount of access to configure certain non-critical functionality, a Jenkins administrator can safely delegate configuration aspects while being confident that security concerns are being met.

The `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` permission type is not intended to replace any `Item` level permissions.
It is solely for the purpose of seperating sensistive, security related Jenkins configuration settings from those that a non-root administrator might be expected to manage.

=== Example Use Case
**Alice** - DevOps Admin - responsible for overall Jenkins infrastructure supporting 100 developers across 6 teams each with their own jenkins instances.  Responsible for defining and enforcing security policies across all teams.

**Bob** - DevOps lead for the FooBar team

==== Scenario

Alice has defined the following company wide security policies:

* AuthN will be handled via SSO backed by the corporate LDAP server
* Role-Based AuthZ is provided by the matrix-auth plugin
* All jenkins instances must only use the company approved update-center
* Only users with Jenkins.ADMINISTER privileges can upload plugins outside of the update-center

Additionally, Alice wants to allow individual DevOps leads to manage other aspects of their Jenkins instances as they deem appropriate for their own teams.  Ex. Bob can configure:

* Project naming conventions
* System Admin e-mail address
* Labels
* View system information

[NOTE]
====
Admittedly, the example use case above is not all that exciting.  However, the change proposed in this JEP creates the foundation for other plugins to begin to differentiate between high-risk (ie. Administer only) settings and those that can be safely delegated to a user with the `Configure` permission.
====

== Reasoning
=== Administrative Monitors only shown to users with `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`
We choose to not show a subset of "safe" Administrative Monitors because it could lead to a false sense of security from the perspecitve of a user with the `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` permission. 
Some critical messages would be only displayed to `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` and a user with `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` might think that everything is fine because nothing is showed but it's not.

=== System Log is only accesible with `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`
In theory, logs shouldn't show sensitive values at any level, and a pluggin logging secrets can be considered a security issue in the actual plugin.
However, it is highly likely that some plugins are logging sensitive values in lowest levels like `FINE`.

Because of this, `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` will not be allowed to access to the System Log or managing Log Recorders.

As part of a future enhancement, a more sophisticated solution might be considered, so someone with `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` can see the log levels considered safe.


=== `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` does not allow installation of plugins available in Update Center
There has been some discussion on the jenkinsci-dev mailing list about wether `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` should allow the installation of plugins available in Update Center (see <<References>>).  
The abiltiy to install or update plugins introduces the possibility (even if it is small) for a malicious user to escalate their privelege to that of `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`.  
Additionally, some administrators may not want users who can update plugin versions to also have the ability manage other aspects of a Jenkins instance.
Because of this, it makes more sense to consider this as a potentially new permission type in the future.

=== `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` implies no other permission

For the sake of customization, we are designing this permission to not imply other permissions that can be granted separately, as long as they are not needed for `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` 's main purpose (see <<Motivation>>).

Hence, it will not imply any `Job`, `View` or `Agent` level permission.

About `Jenkins.READ` (a.k.a `Overall Read`, required to access the web or use the CLI), we have decided to *not* imply it for the following reasons:

* To follow the current standard: Every other permission (except `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`) is not implying it. 
* Technical limitation: the current implementation of `Permission` makes impossible to make `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` imply `Jenkins.READ`, because a permission can not be implied by more than one, and `Jenkins.READ` is already implied by `Permission.READ`. 

image::CONFIGURE-and-READ-permissions.svg[]

This means that in order to provide access with `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` permission, the Administer will have to check both `Overall Read` and `Overall Configure`

=== Decisions we are on the fence about
There are a number of specific permission checks that do not have a clear answer, such as the ability to view log files, or viewing environment variables. 
For the most current discussions on these points (and more) please refer to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4374[the prototype PR for this JEP].

== Backwards Compatibility

No existing permission types are being removed at this point, which will allow for existing plugins that make use of them to continue to function.
Removing code references to the "dangerous" permissions is outside the scope of this JEP.

== Security

The intent of this proposal is to improve overall security for Jenkins instances that are using some form of matrix authorization.
All configuration items that require `Jenkins.ADMINISTER`, `Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS`, `PluginManager.CONFIGURE_UPDATECENTER`, and `PluginManager.UPLOAD_PLUGINS`  are being reviewed to determine if they can be changed to require the new `Jenkins.CONFIGURE` permission type.
The greatest risk is that some configuration may be _more restrictive_ than necessary, either because it was overlooked or due to differences in opinion during the review process.

== Infrastructure Requirements

There are no new infrastructure requirements related to this proposal.

== Testing

Existing tests that validate permissions, or make assumptions about the permissions being used, will be updated to conform to the new permission model.
Additional tests will be written that validate the new permission type cannot be used when the more restrictive `Jenkins.ADMINISTER` is needed.
